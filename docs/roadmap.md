# SurferX Hub — Roadmap

## Phase 1 (MVP — Grant Scope)

### Objectives
- Establish XRPL-native discovery layer
- Prove technical execution capability
- Deliver secure, auditable foundation

### Deliverables
- Read-only XRPL integration
- Token registry and metadata display
- NFT collection discovery
- Wallet connectivity (read-only)
- Open-source documentation

---

## Phase 2 (Post-Grant Expansion)

### Planned Features
- Token creation workflows
- NFT minting tools
- IDO / launch tooling
- Transaction simulation
- Trust-locking primitives

### Notes
Phase 2 is NOT dependent on Phase 1 grant funds.

## Phase 3 (Ecosystem Growth)

### Planned Features
- DeFi automation modules
- Gaming marketplace
- Governance tooling
- Monetization layers

## Funding Separation

- Phase 1: XRPL Grant–funded
- Phase 2+: Separately funded via revenue, partnerships, or future grants

This separation ensures grant funds are used exclusively for MVP delivery.
